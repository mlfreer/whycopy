You now <u>will decide whether or not</u> to delegate <u>the task you just completed</u> to a previous investor. If you decide to delegate, then you will pick a particular previous investor and the computer will automatically choose for you exactly the same asset as that investor chose for that task. If you decide not to delegate, then for that task the computer will just use the asset you already chose. 

<br><br>

Your screen will display the usual information about available assets, in case you decide not to delegate. It will also display a list of five investors who have previously played this game, in case you decide to delegate to one of those investors. For each of those five investors, the display shows the final payments they received, their risk ratings and their quality ratings.

<br><br>

<b>Their risk rating</b> --- High, Medium, or Low --- is based on all their choices during their session. High risk rating means they often made choices that result in a very high payment in one state and a very low payment in the other state, while low risk rating indicates mostly choices that give a moderate payout no matter what the state turns out to be.


<br>
<br>

<b>Their quality rating</b> --- High or Low  --- indicates the “efficiency” of the investor's choices. A low rating indicates that they often could have obtained higher payments in both states if they had made different choices.
