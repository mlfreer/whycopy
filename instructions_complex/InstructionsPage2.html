You will be given a budget of 100 tokens and your task is to allocate this across the assets available. Your overall payoff will depend on how much you choose to allocate in each of the assets and on the outcome of the coin flip.

<br><br> 

In the example below, we explain the payments depending on the asset chosen. If you choose to invest 100 tokens in Option 1 and the coin comes up heads you will receive 9000 tokens. If the coin comes up tails, you will receive 1000 tokens. If you choose to invest 50 tokens in Option 2 and 50 tokens in Option 3 and the coin comes up heads you will receive 6000 tokens. If the coin comes up tails you will receive 3500 tokens. 

<br><br>

To change the allocation you can drag the horizontal bar or use the <b>"+"</b> and <b>"-"</b> buttons.
You can also type directly the number of tokens you want to allocate to the Option in the input form.
