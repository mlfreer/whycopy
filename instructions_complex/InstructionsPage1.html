The next screens explain how to play the investment game in Block 1. Remember, a considerable amount of money is at stake so please pay careful attention to the instructions. 


<br><br>

In this task, you will make 5 decisions. In each of these decisions, you will be given a budget of 100 tokens and can choose to distribute it among several investment options. 


<br>
<br>

At the end of the experiment, <b>one of the decisions made in the first block will be randomly chosen and will determine your payment</b>.

<br><br>

The table on the decision screens will show the payoff of the assets. The payoff of each asset depends on the state of the world. There are two states of the world, (Heads and Tales). Both states are equally likely and which state is realized is determined by a coin flip (through the experimental software).
