In this experiment, you will make five decisions. In each of these decisions, you will choose one of six investment options. 

<br><br>

The table on the decision screen shows how the payoff of each option depends on the state of the world. There are two equally likely states of the world: Heads and Tails. The actual state will be determined by a virtual coin flip (using the computer’s random number generator).

<br><br>

In the example decision below, if you choose Option 1, then you will receive 10 tokens if the coin comes up Heads, and will receive 70 tokens if the coin comes up Tails. 
If you choose Option 2, then you will receive 10 tokens if the coin comes up Heads, and 50 tokens if Tails.
If you choose Option 3, then you will receive 20 tokens if the coin comes up Heads, and 40 tokens if Tails.
If you choose Option 4, then you will receive 22 tokens if the coin comes up Heads, and 34 tokens if Tails.
If you choose Option 5, then you will receive 27 tokens if the coin comes up Heads, and 13 tokens if Tails.
If you choose Option 6, then you will receive 3 tokens if the coin comes up Heads, and 91 tokens if Tails.
