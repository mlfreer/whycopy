You now <u>will decide whether or not</u> to delegate <u>the next task</u> to a previous investor. Either way, you must choose an asset as in previous tasks. If you decide to delegate, then you will pick a particular previous investor and the computer will automatically choose for you exactly the same asset as that investor chose for that task, ignoring your own choice of asset. On the other hand, if you decide not to delegate, then for that task the computer will just use your own choice of asset. 

<br><br>

Your screen will display the usual information about available assets. It will also display a list of five investors who have previously played this game, in case you decide to delegate to one of those investors. For each of those five investors, the display shows the final payments they received, their risk ratings and their quality ratings.

<br><br>

<b>Their risk rating</b> --- High, Medium, or Low --- is based on all their choices during their session. High risk rating means they often made choices that result in a very high payment in one state and a very low payment in the other state, while low risk rating indicates mostly choices that give a moderate payout no matter what the state turns out to be.


<br>
<br>

<b>Their quality rating</b> --- High or Low  --- indicates the “efficiency” of the investor's choices. A low rating indicates that they often could have obtained higher payments in both states if they had made different choices.
