This experiment consists of several tasks, which are divided into two blocks. 

<br>
<br>

The first block contains five tasks. In each of these tasks you are asked to make decisions in different economic choice problems. The second block contains a different type of decision. All decisions in both blocks are potentially relevant for your payment. 

<br>
<br>

At the end of the experiment, <b>one of the decisions made in the first block will be randomly chosen and will determine your payment</b>. This money will be paid in addition to the initial endowment of Â£2.5.

<br>
<br>

Each task of the experiment (including introductory instructions) will be presented on a separate screen. You will only be informed at the very end of the experiment which decision was selected for payment and how large your payment will be.
