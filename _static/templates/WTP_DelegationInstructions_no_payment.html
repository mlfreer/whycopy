You can now choose to either delegate the task to a previous investor or else you can continue making your own choices as in the previous four rounds. If you delegate to a previous investor, then the computer will automatically choose for you exactly the same asset as that investor chose in that round.

<br><br>

If you choose not to delegate, then you would immediately proceed to the next round.
If you decide to delegate you need to determine the maximal price you are willing to pay for delegation.
The prices presented vary from 0 to 20 tokens.
Once you made a choice computer would randomly draw a number between 0 and 20.
If the price is below your specified maximal willingness to pay, then you would proceed to delegation screen.
Otherwise you would proceed to the last decision round.

As usual, your screen will display information you will need if you decide to make your own choices. It will also display a list of five investors who have previously played this game. The display also tells you something about each of those previous investors: their risk ratings and their quality ratings.

<br><br>

<b>Their risk rating</b> --- High, Medium, or Low --- is based on all their choices during their session. High risk rating means they often made choices that result in a very high payment in one state and a very low payment in the other state, while low risk rating indicates mostly choices that give a moderate payout no matter what the state turns out to be.


<br>
<br>

<b>Their quality rating</b> --- High or Low  --- indicates the “efficiency” of the investor's choices. A low rating indicates that they often could have obtained higher payments in both states if they had made different choices.
