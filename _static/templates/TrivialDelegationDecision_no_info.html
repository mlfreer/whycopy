You now choose to either delegate the task to a previous investor or else you can continue making your own choices as in the previous four rounds. If you delegate to a previous investor, then the computer will automatically choose for you exactly the same asset as that investor chose in that round.

<br><br>

As usual, your screen will display information you will need if you decide to make your own choices. It will also display a list of five investors who have previously played this game. The display also tells you something about each of those previous investors: the final payments they received, their risk ratings and their quality ratings.

<br><br>

<b>Their final payments</b>, like yours, come from a single randomly chosen round. Please note that it is often from a different round than that for which you delegate.

<br>
<br>

<b>Their risk rating</b> --- High, Medium, or Low --- is based on all their choices during their session. High risk rating means they often made choices that result in a very high payment in one state and a very low payment in the other state, while low risk rating indicates mostly choices that give a moderate payout no matter what the state turns out to be.


<br>
<br>

<b>Their quality rating</b> --- High or Low  --- indicates the “efficiency” of the investor's choices. A low rating indicates that they often could have obtained higher payments in both states if they had made different choices.
